Student Registration System
About the Project

This project is a simple and responsive Student Registration System developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, and delete student records easily.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) work in a real web application using JavaScript and Local Storage.

All the data entered by the user is stored in the browser using Local Storage, so the records do not disappear after refreshing the page.

Form validation for:
